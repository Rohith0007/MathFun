MathFun Application! My goal is to create a delightful platform that combines learning and
fun, transforming math into an exciting adventure for myself. Throughout the semester, I
made several important choices to enhance my own user experience.

Firstly, I decided to remove the login feature, allowing me to directly access the home page.
This change streamlines my journey and eliminates unnecessary barriers. For the home
page, I carefully selected fonts reminiscent of classic 90s games, like Courier new, creating
a nostalgic and engaging atmosphere. Incorporating animated videos as captivating learning
resources keeps me curious and excited to explore further.

In the game selection page, I implemented dropdown lists for easy filtering of topics.
Currently, I focus on fractions, and I have received positive feedback, which encouraged me
to emphasize this area. To ensure a structured learning experience, I designed levels
sequentially, starting with level 1, "Guess the fraction." Progressing through the levels, I find
each challenge to be fun-filled and educational. Throughout my individual process, I strive to
strike the perfect balance between playfulness and learning. I continuously seek ways to
make math concepts enjoyable, engaging, and accessible.
